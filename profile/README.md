## Hi there, this is Offshore Sync, a new project that will take the world of Offshore by storm 👋

We are an all in one solution for Offshore Industry Workers to have complete control over their working schedule. This allows them to foresee and predict the best dates for travelling, hanging out and having fun with their friends, families and colleagues.
